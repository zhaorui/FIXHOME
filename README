Platform: All Platform except Windows.

Description: Fixhome.pl is used to fix the broken home directory, which uid/gid is a mess. it would use the owner's uid and gid to fix all the files under the home directory and it assume the current home uid/gid is the previous uid/gid of user. So please be absolutely clear when you're using this script. Sorry,I won't promise it won't casue other problem.

Options: -i --include [users,...]include the only user you want to fix.
	 -e --exclude [users,...]exclude the user you don't want to fix.
	 -d [dir] choose the directory as the Home Root.
	 -u only fix the Home directory's uid.
	 -L traverse the symlink directory when we encount one.
